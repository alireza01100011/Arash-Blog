My goal in this project is just to have fun and learn new things, that's why I think it needs extensive optimizations.
I hope that my time will help me and I can optimize this project and solve its various problems, I will be very happy if you take a look at the codes and make them better, thank you, friend.


[note: Basic optimizations in the database section, especially website information, must be done]
